## **Use Case Example**

### Problem
A defense contractor needs an AI-powered tool to analyze source code for errors and optimizations but cannot risk sending sensitive code to external APIs due to strict security requirements.

### Solution
Using the AI Developer’s Assistant:
1. The contractor uploads source code directly into the application.
2. The backend processes the code using a local AI model, accelerated by NVIDIA GPUs.
3. The tool identifies issues, suggests optimizations, and generates unit tests, all within the secure environment.
4. Results are displayed on the frontend for immediate action.
