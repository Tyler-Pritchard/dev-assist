## **Application Architecture Overview**

### **Frontend**
- **Purpose:** 
  - User interface for developers to interact with the assistant.
  - Input options: text/code editors, file upload fields.
  - Display analysis results, optimization suggestions, and generated unit tests.

- **Key Technologies:**
  - React/Typescript for building a responsive UI.
  - Monaco Editor (used in VS Code) for syntax-highlighted code input/output.

### **Backend**
- **Purpose:**
  - Process requests from the frontend.
  - Interact with the AI model for analysis and suggestion generation.
  - Validate inputs and manage file parsing.

- **Key Technologies:**
  - Node.js/Express or Python/Flask.
  - Integration with OpenAI GPT-4 API.

### **AI Model Integration**
- **Purpose:** 
  - Analyze code for bugs and inefficiencies.
  - Provide optimization tips and generate unit tests.

- **Key Technologies:**
  - OpenAI GPT-4 for natural language processing and code generation.
  - Custom prompt engineering for precise outputs.

### **Optional Components**
- **Version Control Integration:**
  - APIs for GitHub/GitLab to fetch and analyze repositories.
- **Error Monitoring:**
  - Integration with error reporting tools like Sentry for real-time debugging.

## **Core Features**

### 1. **Code Analysis**
   - **User Flow:**
     - Upload a file or paste code into the editor.
     - AI scans the code for bugs, inefficiencies, and security vulnerabilities.
     - Results displayed with line-by-line comments or summary highlights.
   - **Example Output:**
     - "Potential NullPointerException in line 12."
     - "Consider using `const` instead of `let` for variables on lines 3 and 8."

### 2. **Unit Test Generation**
   - **User Flow:**
     - Input a function/class in supported languages.
     - AI generates unit test cases using popular frameworks (e.g., Pytest, Jest).
   - **Example Output:**
     - Test case for edge cases, null inputs, and expected behavior.

### 3. **Log File Debugging**
   - **User Flow:**
     - Upload a log file or paste a snippet.
     - AI parses the logs, identifies error patterns, and suggests fixes.
   - **Example Output:**
     - "Error indicates a missing dependency. Consider running `npm install xyz`."

### 4. **Optimization Suggestions**
   - **User Flow:**
     - Analyze specific code snippets for performance improvements.
   - **Example Output:**
     - "Consider using map instead of a for loop for array transformation on line 15."

### 5. **Multi-Language Support**
   - **MVP Languages:**
     - Python, JavaScript, Java (expandable later to C#, Go, etc.).
