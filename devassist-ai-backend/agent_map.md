# ü§ñ AI Developer‚Äôs Assistant ‚Äì Agent Map

This system is designed as a multi-agent AI architecture for secure, self-contained software development assistance. Each agent has a clearly defined role, input/output specification, and modular responsibility. This enables scalable orchestration, self-debugging, and human override where necessary.

## üßπ Agent Communication

All agents are designed to operate as **stateless functions** with shared access to:
- A **project-wide embedding index** (via Workspace Loader + Retriever)
- A **task manager** or orchestrator (e.g. FastAPI endpoint or event bus)
- A standard **message format** (likely JSON-based)

## ‚ú® Design Philosophy

- **Modular**: Each agent can be developed and improved independently.
- **Auditable**: Every step can be logged and reviewed.
- **File-Aware**: Context is informed by actual project files via RAG.
- **Secure by Default**: No calls to external APIs unless explicitly authorized.

# -------AGENT MAP 2----------

# AI Developer‚Äôs Assistant ‚Äì Agent Architecture Map

## Overview
This architecture defines a modular, agent-based system designed to function as an intelligent "robot that builds robots." Each agent is responsible for a clearly defined task and communicates with others via structured APIs or messaging systems. The system supports RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), autonomous planning, evaluation, and correction. This structure is extensible, allowing for new agents like UI generators and linters to be added seamlessly.

---

## üß† Core Agents

### 1. **Supervisor Agent**
- **Role**: Orchestrates and delegates tasks to the other agents. Handles high-level coordination, project state management, and error handling.
- **Input**: User objectives, task completions, errors from Evaluator.
- **Output**: Task assignments, re-routing, logging.
- **Tech**: Finite State Machine + Memory Stack.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Generation Agents

### 2. **Architect Agent**
- **Role**: Converts user input (prompt/spec) into high-level application design and task plans.
- **Input**: Natural language prompts.
- **Output**: Project blueprint ‚Üí components + dependencies + desired UX behavior.
- **Tech**: Large language model with schema generators (e.g. JSON, YAML).

### 3. **Decomposer Agent**
- **Role**: Breaks large tasks into smaller, executable subtasks.
- **Input**: Architect plan.
- **Output**: Ordered task list for implementation.

### 4. **Codegen Agent**
- **Role**: Writes source code for a specific module or file.
- **Input**: Functional spec and file context (via RAG).
- **Output**: One or more code files (inferred language).

### 5. **UI Generator Agent**
- **Role**: Creates styled UI components (React, HTML, Tailwind, etc.) from wireframes or UX descriptions.
- **Input**: Component names, user interactions, UX instructions.
- **Output**: Fully formed UI component code + optional CSS modules.

---

## üîç Validation Agents

### 6. **Evaluator Agent**
- **Role**: Analyzes generated code and reports issues, bugs, or inconsistencies.
- **Input**: Code diffs or full source files.
- **Output**: Analysis report (natural language or structured).

### 7. **Lint Fixer Agent**
- **Role**: Applies linting rules, style conventions, and auto-fixes to maintain clean, idiomatic code.
- **Input**: Raw code.
- **Output**: Formatted code + description of applied lint rules.
- **Ruleset**: Configurable per language (e.g., ESLint, Black, Prettier).

### 8. **Test Agent**
- **Role**: Writes unit and integration tests.
- **Input**: Target source code.
- **Output**: Test files (e.g. Jest, PyTest, Mocha).

---

## üîß Runtime + Feedback Agents

### 9. **Runner Agent**
- **Role**: Executes application components in sandbox mode to detect runtime issues.
- **Input**: Built project (or isolated files).
- **Output**: Runtime logs, stack traces, performance metrics.

### 10. **Debugger Agent**
- **Role**: Diagnoses errors based on logs or test failures. Suggests or makes code fixes.
- **Input**: Stack trace or test result + file context.
- **Output**: Patch or edit suggestions.

---

## üìö Retrieval & Memory Layer

### 11. **RAG Engine (Context Retriever)**
- **Role**: Supplies agents with the most relevant project files or specs.
- **Input**: Embedding query + task description.
- **Output**: Ranked list of file/document snippets.

---

## üîÅ Feedback & Looping
- Each agent can optionally send output to the **Supervisor** for validation before proceeding.
- **Evaluator** and **Runner** may feed into **Debugger**, which either loops back to **Codegen** or applies auto-patches.

---

## Notes for Development
- All agents are stateless and can be deployed as microservices.
- Long-term memory (project state, changes) is persisted in a vector DB + task ledger.
- Agent behavior is prompt-engineered and can be tuned over time.

---

## Roadmap Considerations
- Add a **User Conversation Tracker** to keep track of goals and agent outputs.
- Add **Frontend Bridge** to support real-time updates (e.g., WebSocket).
- Support offline mode with snapshot-aware agents and embedded context.
